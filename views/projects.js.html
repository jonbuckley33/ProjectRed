                    <p>Two summers ago, I interned at an Indie Game Development Studio. I contributed primarily to two projects, <a href="http://bestwindows8apps.net/fleshblender/"> "Fleshblender," </a> a 2D zombie game, and "Thieve's Plummet," an action arcade-style game. Fleshblender was developed for Windows8 using XAML UI design and a modified Box2D physics engine. Thieve's Plummet was developed using the Unity framework, and is targeting multiple platforms for deployment.</p>

                    For <a href="http://hackcmu.com"> HackCMU 2013 </a>, three friends and I developed a web app that hosted all of the dining option information for Carnegie Mellon University. This included location data, open hours, and menu information. In addition, users could vote up and down individual food items. This was developed with a PHP backend and MySQL data store.

                    	Last summer, I interned at <a href="http://cube4solutions.com"> Cube4 LLC </a> as a web developer. Cube4 provides software to employers for them to easily comply with the Affordable Care Act. My work spanned from things as low level as the domain model system to the user interface. The primary application is developed in .NET technologies and leverages the ASP.NET MVC 5 framework.

                    	This fall, at <a href="http://mhacks.org">MHacks 2014</a>, my friend and I developed an ephemeral, anonymous messaging service. It was unique in that the service focused chats on conversation rather than on the people, encouraging deeper conversation than the typical anonymous chat. This service was developed on top of Node JS and ran as a mobile-compliant web app.
