                        In the summer of 2016, I developed an interest in Virtual Reality. After attending a VR fair in Los Angeles (VRLA),
                        I decided I would try my hand at some VR development. The result was a pong-esque game for the Google Cardboard that I developed in Unity. You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/jonbuckley33/PongVR"> here. </a>

                        For my Distributed Systems class in the Fall of 2015, my partner and I wrote a version of the classic arcade game, Asteroids. The twist we added was making the game multiplayer: multiple people can connect to a single host and join their game of shooting and surviving for as long as possible. The multiplayer component leveraged the Paxos algorithm, and the game was written in Go. Source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/jonbuckley33/Asteroids"> here. </a>

                    <p>
                        In the fall of 2014, I made a project where my family members were able to go to a web app and open/close our house's garage doors. Furthermore, I built in the functionality of being able to set a timer for when the garage should be closed, if it isn't already. I accomplished this with an Arduino, a couple servos, two limit switches, and a Node JS app. You can find the source code for the web app portion on <a href="https://github.com/jonbuckley33/GarageOpener"> my github. </a>

                        At <a href="http://mhacks.org">MHacks 2014</a>, my friend and I developed an ephemeral, anonymous messaging service. It was unique in that the service focused chats on conversation rather than on the people, encouraging deeper conversation than the typical anonymous chat. This service was developed on top of Node JS and ran as a mobile-compliant web app.

                    For <a href="http://hackcmu.com"> HackCMU 2013 </a>, three friends and I developed a web app that hosted all of the dining option information for Carnegie Mellon University. This included location data, open hours, and menu information. In addition, users could vote up and down individual food items. This was developed with a PHP backend and MySQL data store.
